# Description

Library for getting words from text.
Currently only handles alphabetical text, only allowing text lower and upper in a-Z range to be obtained.
Much more functional natural language parsing libraries already exist, so this library will focus on simple solutions.

## Usage

See:
./example/template.js

Test:
`npm run test`
